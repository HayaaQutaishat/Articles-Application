# CS50W-Project4-Final

## CS50 Web - Programming with Python and JavaScript. 

### Project purpose :

This website is articles platform. This was the final project of HarvardX's CS50W course in 2022 and was built using Python, Django, Javascript ,CSS, HTML and Bootstrap.

This web application is not similar to anything we have already worked on. It's not a social media app nor an e-commerce website. In this website users will be able to read, rate , comment on those articles, and add any of them to "read later". 


### Project Requirements :

-If the user just want to read some article, he can just click "Random Article" button on the top, and he will get one random article. Additionally, you don't need to log in for those actions. 



-Logged users have the ability to create a new article and add it to the other existing articles.
