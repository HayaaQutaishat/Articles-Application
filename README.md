### Project purpose :

This website is an articles platform. This was the final project of HarvardX's CS50W course in 2022 and was built using Python, Django, Javascript ,CSS, HTML and Bootstrap.

This web application is not similar to anything we have already worked on. It's not a social media app nor an e-commerce website. In this website users will be able to read, rate, comment on those articles, and add any of them to "read later" so they can easily find them later. 


### Project Structure :

-If users just want to read any article, they can just click "Random Article" button on the top, and they will get one random article in a particular topc. Additionally, they don't need to log in for those actions. 

-When users click on "Categories", they will be taken to a page that shows all the categories in the website. (Health, Environmental Issues, Food, Animals and Art). Each category contains number of articles related to the topic. Clicking on any of those categories will take the user to a new page which has all the related articles. 

-Logged users have the ability to create a new article and add it to the other existing articles, add article to "Read Later" where can read the article anytime later, and also they can add comments on any article in the web page.
